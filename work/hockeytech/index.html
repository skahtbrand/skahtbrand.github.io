                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>HockeyTech was founded in 2013 and is comprised of several hockey related company acquisitions.</p>
                        <p>Our goal has been to seamlessly integrate these products together with re-branding and newer technologies.</p>
                        <p>Below are several of the projects I have worked on over the past 5+ years at HockeyTech.</p>
                        <p>HockeyTech was purchased by FloSports in 2021.</p>

                    <h2>Project - Design and Build Integrated Statistics Pages</h2>
                    <p><em>HTML, CSS, AngularJS</em></p>
                    <p>When I started at HockeyTech, the team had just begun adding leagues and teams to their WordPress platform. My first initial project was to take their existing static statistics pages and re-design them to be responsive and to integrate them into WordPress seamlessly.</p>
                    <p>We choose to re-architect the entire back-end and re-design the front-end with AngularJS. Over time, this allowed us to offer real-time statistic pages after the scoring project was completed. The first round of this project took approximately 4 months and polled the data as needed. Today, these live statistic pages that my team pioneered can be seen on 400+ websites.</p>

                    <h2>Project - Design and Build WordPress Themes</h2>
                    <p><em>WordPress, HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript</em></p>
                    <p>The first few leagues/teams that I worked with were on purchased WorkPress themes which did not offer enough flexibility, so I began designing and developing a proprietary HockeyTech WordPress theme. This development work stemmed into the two versions of the theme that currently exist, a standard and a Pro version.&nbsp;These two themes are extremely robust, yet simple to use and have several integrated features specific to hockey including the integrated statistics pages. To get a league/team started, my team provides them with one of the many templates we have, but ultimately, clients may choose to design their layout in any way they want.</p>
                    <p>As of today, there are 400+ league/teams using my custom-made themes.</p>
                    <p><strong>Here are a few live examples of the themes in action:</strong></p>

                    <p><em>Adobe XD, Illustrator, HTML, LESS CSS, AngularJS</em></p>
                    <p>At the time this project was the largest undertaking we as a team had worked on. HockeyTech had acquired a scoring system but it was about 15 years old so you can only imagine what that looked like. As a team we spent about 1 year before it was released. On an average Friday/Saturday night anywhere from 2-400+ games are scored using this system. So, if you have ever wondered how your favourite team gets those live stats now you know.</p>
                    <p>After this was released we then integrated the live scoring data into our statistics pages so you the fan can have real-time scores and statistics.</p>

                    <h2>Project - Re-Design and Build HockeyTV</h2>
                    <p><em>Adobe XD, Photoshop, HTML, LESS CSS, Angular</em></p>
                    <p>HockeyTV is the world’s largest live and on-demand elite hockey streaming platform. The company was acquired roughly a year from when I started under a different name. The product has gone through two re-designs since I have been there. The initial re-design was a smaller project with a styling refresh to match the re-brand of the product using HockeyTech’s style guide. We also created a branded version for the <a href="https://www.ahltv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AHL</a>. The current version of <a href="https://www.hockeytv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HockeyTV</a> was a complete start from scratch with all new coding languages. Initial designs were researched and mocked-up in Adobe XD prior to starting and continue as needed. The latest version was released prior to season start in 2019 and is still under active development with new features released frequently.</p>
                    <p>You can always head over to <a href="https://www.hockeytv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HockeyTV.com</a> and check it out.</p>
